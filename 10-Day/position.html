        Never is this principle more pertinent than when dealing with type, the
        bread and butter of Web-borne communication. A well-set paragraph of
        text is not supposed to wow the reader; the wowing should be left to the
        idea or observation for which the paragraph is a vehicle. In fact, the
        perfect paragraph is unassuming to the point of near invisibility. That
        is not to say that the appearance of your text should have no appeal at
        all. On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a
        thing of beauty; itâ€™s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might
        distract you from reading.
